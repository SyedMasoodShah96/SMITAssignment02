			<h3>	
				Chapter 1	
			</h3>  

				<p>
					Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of <i>Nature</i>, <em>New Scientist</em>, and all the other
					<br> scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <cite>On The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favorite book since college, and the longer she
					<br> spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.
				</p>  
			
					<p>	
						She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have
					<br> nothing better to do</q>. Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of the llama <abbr="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>, to be an outstanding achievement, Molly 
					<br> <em>did</em> think she had something better to do.
